- **Data Modeling**: Best practices for modeling data relationships.

### Database Schema Design Guide

##### Step 1: Identify Entities
- Identify the main entities in your system. These will typically become tables in your database.
Example: Movie, Person, Role

##### Step 2: Define Attributes
- For each entity, list its attributes. These will become columns in your tables. Include primary keys and unique identifiers.   
Example:
- Movie: id, title, release_year, runtime_minutes
- Person: id, name, birth_date
- Role: id, role_name

##### Step 3: Determine Relationships
Identify how entities relate to each other. There are three main types of relationships:

1. One-to-One (1:1)
2. One-to-Many (1:N)
3. Many-to-Many (M:N)

Example:
- A Person can have many Roles in many Movies (M:N)
- A Movie can have many Persons in many Roles (M:N)

##### Step 4: Implement Relationships

###### One-to-One (1:1)
- Use a foreign key in one of the tables to reference the primary key of the other.
- Add a unique constraint on the foreign key.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE UserProfile (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    profile_data TEXT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(id),
    CONSTRAINT uk_user_profile UNIQUE (user_id)
);
```

###### One-to-Many (1:N)
- Add a foreign key in the "many" table referencing the "one" table.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    content TEXT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
);
```

###### Many-to-Many (M:N)
- Create a junction (bridge) table that references both entities.

``````
##### Intuition for Junction Tables

The need for a junction table arises when you have a many-to-many relationship between entities. Here's how to recognize and implement them:

1. Identify the relationship: If you find yourself saying "A can have many B, and B can have many A", you likely need a junction table.
2. Check for additional information: If the relationship itself needs to store data, this confirms the need for a junction table.
3. Create the junction table: Name it after both entities (e.g., MoviePersonRoles) and include foreign keys to both entities.
4. Add any relationship-specific attributes to the junction table.

Example: MoviePersonRoles

1. Identify the relationship:
- A Person can be in many Movies
- A Movie can have many Persons
- A Person can have different Roles in different Movies

2. Check for additional information:
- We need to store which Role a Person had in a specific Movie
- We might want to store character names for actors

3. Create the junction table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE MoviePersonRoles (
       movie_id INTEGER,
       person_id INTEGER,
       role_id INTEGER,
       character_name VARCHAR(255),
       PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, person_id, role_id),
       CONSTRAINT fk_movie FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES Movies(id),
       CONSTRAINT fk_person FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES Persons(id),
       CONSTRAINT fk_role FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES Roles(id)
   );
   ```

4. Add relationship-specific attributes:
- We added `character_name` to store the character an actor played in a specific movie.

``````

###### Self-Referencing Tables
- Use when an entity has a relationship with itself (e.g., employees and managers).

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INTEGER,
    CONSTRAINT fk_manager FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES Employees(id)
);
```

##### Step 5: Normalize the Schema
Apply normalization rules to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
  - First Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate repeating groups
  - Second Normal Form (2NF): Remove partial dependencies
  - Third Normal Form (3NF): Remove transitive dependencies

##### Step 6: Add Constraints
Add constraints to ensure data integrity:
  - Primary Keys
  - Foreign Keys
  - Unique Constraints
  - Check Constraints

##### Step 7: Consider Indexing
Add indexes to columns that will be frequently searched or joined.

Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_title ON Movies(title);
CREATE INDEX idx_person_name ON Persons(name);
```

CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation_id ON Messages(conversation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_parent_message_id ON Messages(parent_message_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversation_participants_user_id ON ConversationParticipants(user_id);

/*
Explanation of how this design allows each functionality:

1. Send direct messages:
   - Create a Conversation with is_group_chat set to FALSE.
   - Add two users to the ConversationParticipants table for this conversation.
   - Users can then send messages by inserting rows into the Messages table with the corresponding conversation_id.

2. Send group messages:
   - Create a Conversation with is_group_chat set to TRUE.
   - Add multiple users to the ConversationParticipants table for this conversation.
   - Users can send messages to the group by inserting rows into the Messages table with the corresponding conversation_id.

3. Send replies (threads):
   - When sending a reply, insert a new row in the Messages table with the parent_message_id set to the message_id of the message being replied to.
   - This creates a hierarchical structure of messages, allowing for threaded conversations.
   - Replies can be made to both direct and group messages, as the parent_message_id is independent of the conversation type.

#### Q.6
- Design the database schema for maintaining the information about the students, courses and grades acquired by the students. It is a small school and there is no concept of departments e.g. Computer Science, Electronics, etc. Below are types of requests which principal is expecting from parents/students in future which need to be served:
  1. What was the grade of the student S for course C?
  2. List all courses are taken by student S?
  3. What all course were taught in semester S?  

In order to serve above requests, he/she want to store the below data/info:  
   1. first name
   2. last name
   3. display name (first name + last name)
   4. course name
   5. course code
   6. credits
   7. prerequisite course
   8. instructor
   9. semester
   10. year
   11. grade

- How will we handle cases where?
  - Particular course has another course as prerequisites.
  - Particular course has multiple active courses as prerequisites.

#### Q.7
- Design DB for a shared shopping cart experience for multiple online stores. Following are the requirements:
It is multi tenant. That is all data lives in one database.
The schema should include everything from a User signs in, all the way until check-out. Billing is explicitly out of scope as that is handled by PayFriend.

Handle a customer complaint that they put their item in their cart and then the price was different at check out time, she wants to know how this could happen?
OR
Inventory person at one store noticed that he updated an inventory Items price but there were items sold after that point in time that were sold at the old price? How could that happen?

Update the design to fix the issue in both cases

1. Assumes the network is reliable
2. Assumes latency is 0
3. Assumes bandwidth is infinite
4. Assumes the network is secure
5. Assumes network topology doesn't change
6. Assumes there is a single administrator
7. Assumes data transport cost is 0
8. Assumes the network is homogeneous


𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬:

1. Implements retries, timeouts, and fallbacks to handle unreliable networks
2. Uses asynchronous systems, caching, batching, and parallel processing to keep latency low
3. Compresses data and uses CDN to reduce bandwidth usage
4. Implements encryption, secure protocols, and firewalls to make the network secure
5. Uses service discovery and keeps design simple to adapt to network topology changes
6. Restricts system access based on roles and permissions, and uses proper auth mechanisms
7. Uses smart data sync mechanisms and compresses data to reduce costs of data transfer
8. Keeps the system flexible to operate on different types of servers
  
1. Consider using a Cache for read-heavy systems.
2. For low latency, use a Cache & CDN.
3. Utilize a Message Queue for async processing in write-heavy systems.
4. Choose an RDBMS or SQL Database for ACID compliance.
5. Opt for a No-SQL Database for unstructured data without ACID requirements.
6. Use Blob/Object storage for systems with complex data like videos, images, files, etc.
7. Employ a Message Queue & Cache for systems with complex pre-computation tasks like a news feed.
8. Use a search index, tries, or a search engine (like Elasticsearch) for high-volume data searching.
9. Consider Database Sharding for scaling SQL Databases.
10. Use a Load Balancer for High Availability, Performance, & Throughput.
11. Employ a CDN for faster global data delivery, reliability, high availability, & performance.
12. Choose a Graph Database for systems with data involving nodes, edges, and relationships.
13. Implement Horizontal Scaling for scaling various components (servers, databases, etc.).
14. Utilize Database Indexes for high-performing database queries.
15. Use Batch Processing & Message Queues for bulk job processing.
16. Employ a Rate Limiter to reduce server load and prevent DOS attacks.
17. Consider using an API Gateway (Authentication, SSL Termination, Routing, etc.) for systems with microservices.
18. Implement Redundancy for components with a single point of failure.
19. Implement Data Replication (creating multiple copies of data on different servers) for fault tolerance and durability.
20. Use Websockets for fast, bi-directional user-to-user communication.
21. Implement a Heartbeat mechanism for detecting failures in distributed systems.
22. Ensure data integrity using a Checksum Algorithm.
23. Implement Consistent Hashing to efficiently scale servers with node add/removal and avoid hotspots.
24. Use Gossip Protocol for decentralized data transfer between servers.
25. Utilize Quadtree, Geohash, etc., for location-based functionalities like maps and nearby resources.
26. Prefer generic names like message queues, object storage, etc., instead of specific technology names.
27. Mention that a system with High Availability cannot have strong consistency; eventual consistency is possible.
28. Explain DNS (Domain Name System) when discussing how domain name queries resolve IP addresses in browsers.
29. Implement Pagination to limit response data for network requests with a large amount of data.
30. Use LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache eviction policy and understand its Data Structure and Implementation.
